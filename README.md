# The Legend of Z

## Background

This game was built as a final project for **Oregon State University CS 419 - Software Projects**.
It was built by **Ellard Gerritsen van der Hoop** [@Ellard24](https://github.com/ellard24), **Michael Hueter** [@hueter](https://github.com/hueter), and **Peter Murphy** [@murphpet](https://github.com/murphpet). None of us had any game development experience.

We built this in 10 weeks (from September to December 2016) using [Unity3d](https://unity3d.com/). The scripts are all written in C#.

**We used free online assets.** We don't own any of the assets, so we did not include them in this demo repository. We just included our (often times horrible hacky) C# scripts. We wanted to give other people ideas so they could build off ours and **make better games**.


**Here are the sources of most our assets:**

## Play the Game 

Download the zip of your choice under [Releases](https://github.com/hueter/legend-of-z/releases) in this repo. 

**Notes:** 

1. Ignore the antivirus warning when you open the executable.
2. The OSX version is basically in Beta, because the run speed of Link is a bit buggy (probably due to differences in delta T calculations on OS clocks).
